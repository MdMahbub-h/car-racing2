# TODO: Adjust Codes for Empty Car Game Project

## Overview

Unify the project into a modular Phaser game using js/ files. Update configs for consistency (height 1200 for mobile). Populate scenes with basic car racing logic: preload assets, start screen, gameplay (car control, avoid obstacles), end screen. Integrate into index.html.

## Steps

1. [x] Update index.html to remove inline Game class and use modular js/ setup.
2. [x] Update js/main.js config to match index.html (width 800, height 1200, add plugins, scale mode, etc.).
3. [x] Populate js/PreloadScene.js with asset loading (images, sounds, fonts).
4. [x] Populate js/StartScene.js with start screen (title, play button).
5. [x] Populate js/GameScene.js with basic gameplay (player car, obstacles, movement, collision detection, finish line).
6. [x] Populate js/EndScene.js with end screen (win/lose, replay button).
7. [x] Test the game by running index.html in browser.
